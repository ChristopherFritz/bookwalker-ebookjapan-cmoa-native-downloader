 * Shared loader for the built userscript.
 *
 * The suite must be hermetic. A developer who has the real mokuro bridge running
 * (which is the normal state when working on this script) would otherwise have
 * its 48 fetch-proxy ports discovered by every test page and mixed into the lane
 * pool, so distribution assertions like "round-robin stays balanced" or "the
 * dotted host gets its own pool" would be measuring the bridge rather than the
 * code under test.
 *
 * Pointing the bridge URL at a closed port keeps discovery off. Tests that want
 * a bridge supply their own stub and pass { bridge: true }.
